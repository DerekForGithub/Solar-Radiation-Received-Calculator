# Solar-Radiation-Received-Calculator
This code uses physical and mathematical way to calculate how much amount of solar radiation will be received on a board placed in different place on earth throughout a single day and a whole year.  
The result will be determined by parameters of the time of a year, the size of the board, latitude of the board, tilt angle of the board, declination of the sun, the amount of rotational axis of the board, total solar radiation amount, atmosphere scattering ratio. All of which can be modified in the code.  
The code was inspired from IMMC2026 Autumn Problem B, where required to calculate the amount of power generated by a solar panal based on the parameters above.  
# Written in Python.   
The code is simple, no complex algorithm was used. But the mathematical and physical derive was quite hard and complex.  
Hope this code can lend a helping hand to whomever in need, reducing the time of deriving and calculating.
